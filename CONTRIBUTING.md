- Document any performance regressions
- Include benchmarks in pull requests
- Consider scalability implications

## Code Review Process

1. All contributions require review
2. Maintainers will review for:
   - Code quality and style
   - Performance impact
   - Documentation completeness
   - Test coverage

3. Address review feedback promptly
4. Be open to suggestions and improvements
